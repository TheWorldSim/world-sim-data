# World Sim data

This data repo supports World Sim.

The World Sim is a collaborative project where you can learn about our complex world through games.

    TODO get video of building wind turbines and coal plants and finishing a level

Those simulations contain lots of data and complex relationships that as a player you can learn intuitively.  And can learn without ever having to understand compound O&M (operations and maintenance) costs or [trigonometry for solar](https://github.com/pingswept/pysolar/blob/0c61df6/pysolar/solar.py#L50) insolation for solar panels.

But that data and those relationships need to live somewhere and that's what this repository is for.

## Future plans

Add multiple maintainers to the repo to allow more than one objective reviewer to accept changes.
To make it easier for people to contribute the data: build a web tool to simplify editing, adding, questioning, discussing and resolving disputed data more easily.
Move to using the web tool for all changes to the repo.
